# Trivial PDBQT File Handling  
**PDBQT** = (Protein Data Bank, Partial Charge (Q), & Atom Type (T))  
It will remove 1st and last line from the file and recreate the file in a new folder 
The operation will be performed on all files that exist in the folder 

Steps to Run: 
- 1 => Copy Program into desired folder 
- 2 => Run program by double click or by Enter Key on it
- 3 => Enter file extension .txt Or .pdbqt
- 4 => Press Enter to exit 

What is the format of a PDBQT file?
AutoGrid 3 uses a PDBQS file for the receptor, which stores the atomic coordinates, partial charges and solvation parameters for all the atoms in the macromolecule. AutoDock 3 uses a PDBQ file for the ligand, which stores the atomic coordinates, partial charges and a description of the rigid and rotatable parts of the molecule.
